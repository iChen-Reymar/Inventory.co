2. Upload a square image (512x512px recommended)
3. Download all generated sizes
4. Place them in this folder

### Option 2: Use the SVG Template

1. The `icon.svg` file in this folder is a template
2. Use an online converter like: https://cloudconvert.com/svg-to-png
3. Convert to all required sizes
4. Save as PNG files with the names above

### Option 3: Create Manually

Use any image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, Figma, etc.) to:

## Icon Design Guidelines

- Use your brand color (#4a90e2 - primary blue)
- Keep design simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Ensure good contrast
- Use square aspect ratio
- Recommended: White background with blue icon, or blue background with white icon

## Temporary Solution

If you need to test immediately, you can:
1. Copy any square PNG image
2. Rename it to match all the required sizes (or use the same file for all)
3. The app will still work, though icons may not be optimized
