# Creating App Icons for Inventory.co

To make your app installable, you need to create app icons in different sizes.

## Option 1: Generate Icons Online (Recommended)

1. Create a square logo (at least 512x512px) with your app icon
2. Visit one of these online icon generators:
   - https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
   - https://realfavicongenerator.net/
   - https://www.favicon-generator.org/

3. Upload your logo and download all the generated icons
4. Place them in the `/public/icons/` folder with these names:
   - icon-72x72.png
   - icon-96x96.png
   - icon-128x128.png
   - icon-144x144.png
   - icon-152x152.png
   - icon-192x192.png
   - icon-384x384.png
   - icon-512x512.png

## Option 2: Create Icons Manually

1. Design a square icon (512x512px recommended) with:
   - Blue background (#4a90e2)
   - White box/inventory icon in the center
   - Simple, clear design that works at small sizes

2. Resize to all required sizes using an image editor
3. Save as PNG files in the `/public/icons/` folder

## Option 3: Use a Simple SVG (Quick Start)

For now, you can use the existing vite.svg or create a simple icon using the logo design from your app.

## Icon Design Suggestions

- Use your primary blue color (#4a90e2) as background
- Add a white box/package/inventory icon in the center
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Ensure good contrast for visibility
